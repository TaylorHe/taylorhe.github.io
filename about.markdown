Welcome to Cache Miss, where I ramble about computer science topics, and probably other non-related topics like finance or anything interesting I come across, really.

I've never written a blog post before, so I guess I'll start off by introducing myself.

My name is Taylor, and I solve problems with code. I constantly try to challenge myself, and I never settle for anything less than 70%. My highest endorsed skill on LinkedIn is "Memes" by far, and I would like to keep it that way.

The blogs posts will written with no audience in mind, so topics might be all over the place. If you want to talk more about anything I write about, feel free to shoot me an email.

Welcome again, and I hope you find my future posts useful!
